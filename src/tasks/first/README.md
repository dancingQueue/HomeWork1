Homework â„–1

In this task, I had to implement a command line application more known as "Hello, world!"

To run this program you have to follow the next instructions:

1. In your command line type: 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dancingQueue/HomeWork1
  ```
  
2. Now you can step into homework_1 folder: 
  ```bash
  cd HomeWork1/
  ```
  
3. Then you have to compile HelloWorld.java using javac
  ```bash
  javac src/tasks/first/HelloWorld.java
  ```


4. After successful compilation you can run HelloWorld program as follows and see the result
  ```bash
  java -cp ./src tasks.first.HelloWorld
  Hello, world!
  ```
